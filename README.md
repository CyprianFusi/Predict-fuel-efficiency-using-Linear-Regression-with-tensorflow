# Predict-fuel-efficiency-using-Linear-Regression-with-tensorflow
This project demonstrates the **power of introducing non-linearity** in neural network models to capture relevant patterns in data.

We are going to make use of modules and functions from the Keras API to train a linear regression model to predict fuel efficiency from features such as `cylinders, displacement, horsepower`, and `weight`. We shall train both shallow and deep neural network models and compare them. We use non-linear `ReLU` activation function in the hidden layers of a neural network model to capture the non-linear relationships between features and target.

## Dataset
We will use the classic [Auto MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) dataset and demonstrates how to build models to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. The dataset is also available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).
